2. **`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`**
   - Added animations.css stylesheet link

## 🎯 Animation Features

### Framer Motion-Style Animations
**Implemented via Stimulus Controller:**
- `fadeIn` - Smooth opacity transitions
- `slideUp` - Slide from bottom with fade
- `slideLeft` - Slide from right with fade
- `slideRight` - Slide from left with fade
- `scale` - Scale up from 90% to 100%
- `rotate` - Rotate and scale simultaneously
- `stagger` - Staggered animations for child elements

**Usage Example:**
```erb
<div data-controller="framer">
  <div data-framer-target="fadeIn" data-delay="100">Content</div>
  <div data-framer-target="slideUp" data-delay="200">Content</div>
  <div data-framer-target="stagger" data-stagger-delay="100">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### CSS Animation Classes
**Available Animations:**
- `.animate-blob` - Morphing blob animation
- `.animate-float` - Floating elements
- `.animate-gradient-x` - Horizontal gradient animation
- `.animate-shimmer` - Shimmer effect for buttons
- `.animate-scroll-down` - Scroll indicator animation
- `.animate-glow` - Pulsing glow effect
- `.card-3d` - 3D card transforms on hover
- And 20+ more...

## 🎨 Color Palette

**Primary Gradients:**
- Indigo → Purple → Pink (Main brand gradient)
- Purple → Pink (Accent gradient)
- Indigo → Blue (Cool gradient)
- Cyan → Purple (Highlight gradient)

**Background Colors:**
- Indigo-50, Purple-50, Pink-50 (Light backgrounds)
- White with gradient overlays
- Transparent gradients with blur effects

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Rails Server
```bash
rails server
# or specify port
rails server -p 3000
```

### 2. Visit the Landing Page
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test Animations
- Scroll through the page to see animations trigger
- Hover over buttons, cards, and interactive elements
- Try on different screen sizes (responsive)

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration
All animations use:
- `transform: translateZ(0)` for GPU acceleration
- `will-change` properties for smooth animations
- `backface-visibility: hidden` to prevent flickering

### Reduced Motion Support
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* All animations disabled or minimized */
  animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
}
```

### Lazy Loading
- Animations only trigger when elements enter viewport
- Intersection Observer with 10% threshold
- Once animated, elements are unobserved to save resources

## 📊 Browser Compatibility

**Fully Supported:**
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Older browsers show static content without animations
- All functionality remains accessible

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

1. **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy with size, color, and spacing
2. **Consistency**: Consistent spacing system (multiples of 4)
3. **Contrast**: High contrast for accessibility
4. **White Space**: Generous padding and margins
5. **Animation Purpose**: Every animation serves a purpose
6. **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations
7. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Changing Animation Durations
In `framer_controller.js`:
```javascript
static values = {
  duration: { type: Number, default: 600 }, // Change default duration
  staggerDelay: { type: Number, default: 100 } // Change stagger timing
}
```

### Modifying Colors
In your ERB files, update Tailwind classes:
- `from-indigo-600` → `from-blue-600` (change gradient start)
- `to-purple-600` → `to-pink-600` (change gradient end)
- `text-indigo-600` → `text-blue-600` (change text color)

### Adjusting Animation Speeds
In `animations.css`:
```css
.animate-blob {
  animation: blob 10s infinite; /* Change 10s to desired duration */
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Remaining Sections to Enhance:
1. **Portfolio Section** - Add image overlays, parallax effects
2. **Process Section** - Timeline animations, step indicators
3. **Testimonials** - Carousel with smooth transitions
4. **CTA Section** - Interactive form with validation animations

### Additional Enhancements:
- Add scroll-triggered number animations for more stats
- Implement particle effects in hero background
- Add micro-interactions for buttons and links
- Create loading animations for page transitions
- Add parallax scrolling effects
