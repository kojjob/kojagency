## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
```ruby
# Example: Rich domain model with business logic
class Lead < ApplicationRecord
  # Clear, business-focused validations
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
  validates :budget_range, inclusion: { in: %w[small medium large enterprise] }
  
  # Business logic methods
  def calculate_score
    LeadScoringService.new(self).calculate_score
  end
  
  def high_priority?
    lead_score >= 80
  end
end

# Example: Service object for complex business logic
class LeadScoringService
  def initialize(lead)
    @lead = lead
  end
  
  def calculate_score
    # Clear, testable business algorithm
    score = budget_weight * 0.35 + 
            timeline_weight * 0.25 + 
            complexity_weight * 0.20 + 
            quality_weight * 0.20
    (score * 100).round
  end
  
  private
  
  # Private methods for score components
end
```

### Testing Approach
```ruby
# Example: Comprehensive model testing
RSpec.describe Lead, type: :model do
  describe '#calculate_score' do
    context 'with high-value characteristics' do
      let(:lead) do
        build(:lead,
          budget_range: 'enterprise',
          timeline: 'asap',
          project_type: 'data'
        )
      end
      
      it 'returns high score for premium prospects' do
        expect(lead.calculate_score).to be >= 80
      end
    end
  end
end

# Example: System test for user workflows
RSpec.describe 'Lead Submission', type: :system do
  it 'successfully creates qualified lead' do
    visit root_path
    
    fill_in 'Name', with: 'Enterprise Client'
    fill_in 'Email', with: 'cto@enterprise.com'
    select '$500k+', from: 'Budget Range'
    
    expect { click_button 'Get Free Estimate' }
      .to change(Lead, :count).by(1)
    
    expect(Lead.last.lead_score).to be >= 70
  end
end
```

### UI/UX Patterns
```erb
<!-- Example: Professional, conversion-focused design -->
<div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300 p-8">
  <div class="w-16 h-16 bg-primary-100 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center mb-6">
    <!-- Icon representing service -->
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
    <%= service.name %>
  </h3>
  
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
    <%= service.description %>
  </p>
  
  <!-- Business-focused features list -->
  <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
    <% service.key_benefits.each do |benefit| %>
      <li class="flex items-center text-gray-700">
        <svg class="w-4 h-4 text-primary-500 mr-2"><!-- Checkmark --></svg>
        <%= benefit %>
      </li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="text-primary-600 font-semibold">
    Starting at <%= number_to_currency(service.base_price) %>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Common Patterns & Solutions

### Lead Management Workflow
```ruby
class LeadWorkflowJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(lead_id)
    lead = Lead.find(lead_id)
    
    # Calculate score
    lead.calculate_score
    
    # CRM sync
    CrmIntegrationService.new(lead).sync_to_hubspot
    
    # Automated follow-up based on score
    schedule_follow_up(lead)
    
    # Internal notifications
    notify_team_if_high_priority(lead)
  end
end
```

### Performance Optimization
```ruby
# Efficient queries with includes
@projects = Project.published
                  .includes(:client, :services, :technologies, :project_metrics)
                  .order(:featured, :completed_at)

# Caching expensive operations
def roi_calculation
  Rails.cache.fetch("project_#{id}_roi", expires_in: 1.hour) do
    calculate_complex_roi_metrics
  end
end
```
