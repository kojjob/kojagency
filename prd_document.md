## Business Logic & Algorithms

### Lead Scoring Algorithm
```ruby
score = (budget_weight * 0.35) + 
        (timeline_weight * 0.25) + 
        (complexity_weight * 0.20) + 
        (quality_weight * 0.10) + 
        (completeness_weight * 0.10)

Budget Weights:
- Enterprise (500k+): 1.0
- Large (100k-500k): 0.85
- Medium (25k-100k): 0.65
- Small (<25k): 0.35

Timeline Weights:
- ASAP: 1.0
- 1 Month: 0.85
- 3 Months: 0.65
- 1 Year: 0.35
```

### Automated Workflows
```ruby
# Lead Processing Workflow
1. Lead Created → Calculate Score
2. Score >= 80 → Immediate Admin Notification
3. Score >= 50 → 2-hour Follow-up
4. Score < 50 → Next Business Day Follow-up
5. CRM Sync → HubSpot/Salesforce Contact Creation
6. Email Automation → Welcome Sequence Based on Score
